SELECT COUNT(number), SUM(number), AVG(number), MAX(number), MIN(number), ROUND(number, decimals), 
FLOOR(number), CEIL(number), CEILING(), TRUNCATE()


FLOOR(): rounds the decimal DOWN to the closest integer.  FLOOR(25.9) = 25
CEIL(): rounds the decimal UP to the closest integer.     CEIL(25.2) = 26
CEILING(): 
TRUNCATE(number, decimals): truncates a number to the specified number of decimals.  TRUNCATE(135.3750000, 2) = 135.37
REPLACE(string,'char_to_replace','replace_with'): replaces a char in a string with another char (can work with numbers as well!). REPLACE(Salary,'0','') = replace all the 0 with nothing (=removes all 0's)
ABS() function returns the absolute value of a given value.
SQRT( number ): returns the square root of a number.
POWER(base_number, exponent): returns the value of a number raised to the power of another number.
REPEAT(stringToRepeat, NumberOfRepeats): repeats a string as many times as specified.       
E.g. SET @number = 21; SELECT REPEAT('* ', @number := @number - 1) from information_schema.tables; This will repeat a pattern a specific number of times, 
each time printing on less '*' because we have the variable decremeting: @number:= @number -1

BEST PRACTICES

- Find largest/smallest values
Using GROUP BY column ASC and LIMIT 1, will allow to select the smallest value of the column
SELECT column
FROM table
GROUP BY column ASC /*for min, or DESC for max */
LIMIT 1

- subqueries

- row index (e.g. to compute median)


CONDITIONS

- BETWEEN CONDITION
expression BETWEEN value1 AND value2;
SELECT TRUNCATE(SUM(LAT_N),4)
FROM STATION
WHERE LAT_N BETWEEN 38.7880 AND 137.2345
